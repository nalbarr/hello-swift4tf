These are notes to self getting started with Swift for TensorFlow Deep Learning Library.  I first learned about while perusing Jeremy Howard's Fastai MOOC course and was working in parallel to combine thoughts along with Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai AI For Medicine specialization.

The project is still early stage and although example notebooks and models are running - these notes represents going a level deeper to understand how Swift and Python are working underneath the covers.

## Assumptions
I tested this on Macos running Catalina with Xcode 11 with 5/13 - Development branch.

## How to run

### Make has easy targets to run through incrementally harder tasks to both understand core concepts and also validate your environment.
`make help`

## Caveats
As of mid May 2020.  S4TF is still evolving and still getting product roadmapped.
